# Stock Market Prediction Application

This application aims to predict stock market prices using machine learning techniques. It collects historical stock market data, preprocesses the data, performs feature engineering, trains a regression model, and provides predictions for future stock prices.

## Features

- Data collection from an API
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling)
- Feature engineering (creating additional features)
- Model training (linear regression)
- Saving and loading the trained model
- Stock market price prediction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Set up your API key:
- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
- Open the `.env` file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.
2. Run the main application: `python main.py`
3. Follow the prompts to perform data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
4. View the predictions generated by the model.
